## c100 rev. a

![Control PCB](c100_rev_a.png "Control PCB") 

In the first revision of the PCBs are some minor errors. (This is the version from the 32C3 workshop)

* SCL of the shift registers are floating, they need to be connected to 5V
* A pullup resistor is missing on the USB data lines
* LED silkscreen missing, they are on the right of the controller
